# Smart-Implant-Project
A prototype of a wired smart cardiac pacemaker with continuous monitoring functionality, featuring low-power Bluetooth communication and wireless charging capabilities.
## The overall objective of this intelligent cardiac pacemaker system is:
1.Real-time, high-precision, and highly sensitive monitoring of the patient's ECG, motion inertial status, internal temperature of the implantable device, external electrode temperature, and battery voltage.<br/>
2.Upon detecting bradycardia, the device delivers a pacing pulse current within an extremely short timeframe to initiate pacing.<br/>
3.All monitoring data is stored in real time in the storage unit. The implantable device's storage capacity can store at least 15 days of monitoring data.<br/>
4.Can communicate with the patient's mobile app via low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to transmit real-time and historical data to the patient's mobile device. Patients can view real-time and historical ECG waveforms and intelligent analysis through the mobile app, as well as check implant-related alerts and abnormal notifications.<br/>
5.Historical ECG data and device logs can be uploaded to the cloud via the mobile app. The cloud stores historical data and performs intelligent analysis. Medical personnel can access the cloud service to view patients' historical ECG data, device anomaly data, and intelligent analysis results.<br/>
6.Wireless charging is supported, with a single charge providing over 7 days of battery life. When the wireless charging transmitter is in operation, it must be connected to the mobile app via a data cable to initiate charging. If the implant temperature becomes abnormal, the transmitter will automatically shut down.<br/>
7.The overall dimensions of the implant should be less than 40mm x 40mm x 15mm, with excellent safety and biocompatibility.<br/>

### Wireless charging module
This paper analyses the calculation principles of key parameters related to wireless charging, including topological structures, inverter modes, coils, and resonant frequencies, and conducts simulation tests using MATLAB Simulink. However, due to the war, it is difficult to purchase materials, and no physical tests have been conducted yet.

### Wireless charging control design
&emsp;&emsp;Due to the possible temperature rise caused by wireless charging, the temperature of the implant must be strictly monitored and controlled to ensure safety.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;One temperature sensor (within MPU6050) and the NTC of the external electrode on board of the main control of the implant, a total of 3 sets of temperature values are collected by the main control in real time and can be transmitted to the patient's cell phone terminal. Therefore, during wireless charging, it must be controlled through the cell phone terminal, and the charging transmitter is allowed to operate only when all 3 sets of temperatures are within the safe range value (40Â°C).<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;To do this, a relay can be designed to turn on and off the 12V DC input of the transmitter, and the relay signal is controlled by the signal output from another ESP32C3 development board, which interacts with the cell phone APP through the serial port via the USB cable.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;This design can realize the wireless charging when the three sets of temperature values are normal, during the process of the cell phone app to monitor the temperature is abnormal, immediately through the serial port to send commands to stop charging.<br/>

### Pacing pulse constant current circuit module
 &emsp;&emsp;This module is an experimental exploration of a simple pulse constant current generation circuit, based on the above hardware, add a control circuit and constant current generation circuit, through the intelligent master control to detect sinus bradycardia, to real-time output of a typical pulse constant current, and strictly control the pulse time of microseconds.<br/>
 &emsp;&emsp;This project only explores a kind of experimental pacing pulse constant current generation design, the relevant parameters are in line with the characteristics of pacing current, but to be used in human beings, its safety and so on need to be explored rigorously.<br/>

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niceguyhere/implant-project/refs/heads/master/image/41.png" width="700"  height="350" />
 &emsp;&emsp;The AD8232 ECG detection circuit and pacemaker pulse generator circuit have been improved and integrated, while strictly adhering to safety requirements, and the following safety functions have been achieved:
1. Leakage current at both ends of the electrode is almost 0, much less than the international standard of 10uA. and the electrode has been kept connected under normal conditions, normal overcurrent ECG signal, no distortion and no significant attenuation. The selection of all components strictly consider the overcurrent and voltage, and try to miniaturize (0402), using high precision (1%), the board size increase is not obvious.<br/>
2. When sinus bradycardia is detected, the pacing pulse generator circuit outputs a constant current pulse of 5mA. The pacing pulse circuit chip is overvoltage protected and self clamps when it exceeds 5V. When there is an extreme internal failure, when the voltage is greater than 7.2V, the pacing generator circuit TVS will break down, blowing the disposable SMD fuse, and there will be no more output from the pulse constant current circuit.<br/>
3. The AD8232 cardiac detection circuit can safely clamp large voltage pulses of up to 700V at the electrodes.<br/>
4. The large voltage withstand diode at the LA electrode of the pacing pulse circuit can effectively block the external large voltage pulse.<br/>
5. The RA electrode of the pacing pulse circuit has two voltage divider circuits and a high-speed comparator, so that when a potential of 6V is detected at the LA electrode, the path from the LA electrode to the pacing pulse circuit is immediately cut off by a MOS tube.<br/>
 &emsp;&emsp;A comprehensive analysis and effective estimation of the action delay and shutdown delay of the pacemaker pulse generator circuit were performed. The delays are fully compliant with the system design objectives and have minimal impact on related functions. Subsequent testing can be conducted by simulating pacemaker pulses and performing animal experiments, using an oscilloscope to test the electrocardiogram signals and safety, including response time.<br/>
